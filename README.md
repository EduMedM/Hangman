# Hangman
My first game in Python.

In the first version you could only play with the topics placed within the program.
The latest version has a menu with 4 more functions, in addition to playing:
1.- Play.
2.- Add words to a topic.
3.- Add a new topic.
4.- Display topic words.
5.- Exit.
The Topics and their names and help messages are saved in a txt file.
To play make sure you have the .py file along with the .txt files in the same directory.
