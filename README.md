# Hangman
My first game in Python.  
In the first version you could only play with the topics placed within the program.

**The latest version has a menu with 4 more functions, in addition to playing:**  
1.- Play.  
2.- Add words to a topic.  
3.- Add a new topic.  
4.- Display topic words.  
5.- Exit.  

The Topics and their names and help messages are saved in a txt file.  
To play make sure you have the .py file along with the .txt files in the same directory.
